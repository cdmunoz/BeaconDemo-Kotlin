A demo project for Android using Kotlin and Rx to identify emisions from a particular Beacon, then identify them and triggers a logic. In this example, a notification object is created indicating that the user is near or far from the region of the beacon. The reading process of the beacons is set in a service. Also there are a couple of options in the code with broadcast receiver and discovering of nearables.
